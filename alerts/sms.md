## Send an SMS notification by using the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service
{: #sms-mon}

When the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service sends a notification to the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service, an alert is triggered in the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance. In the *Events* view section, you can then configure an event for that type of alert to send an SMS through the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service.

Complete the following steps to get an SMS notification when an alert in the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service is triggered:

### Step 1. Configure an alert in {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}
{: #sms-mon-step1}

## Send an SMS notification by using the PagerDuty On Call Service
{: #sms-pd}

When the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service sends a notification (event) to PagerDuty, an alert incident is created in PagerDuty and an SMS is sent if the escalation policy and on-call responder details include the rule to send to an SMS number.
- An incident is the issue that needs to be resolved. It can have 3 states: `triggered`, `acknowledged`, and `resolved`
- An incident triggers a PagerDuty service that generates 1 or more notifications to go out to on-call responders according to the service's escalation policy. SMS is a type of notification. You must configure a service so that it includes the escalation policy that indicates how to connect a service to individual users and schedules.

    A service includes information about the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service as an inbound integration that sends notifications to PagerDuty.

    A service profile provides information such as collaboration across teams, who owns the service, whoâ€™s on-call, how to contact the Team responsible for the service and more.

- A User Profile includes information about on-call responders such as the phone number, SMS number, and email address. The information is used to contact the user when an incident is assigned to the user. You must configure the user profiles and check that the SMS details are correct.

- An SMS provides basic information about the alert. The alert can include 1 or more incidents. When multiple incidents are triggered and assigned to a user, the SMS notification bundles all notifications for the user into 1 SMS. You can click on an incident link to see more details. You can acknowledge or resolve the incident with a text reply.

    The maximum number of characters in a text message is 160. Any text message that has more than 160 characters is truncated.
    {: note}

- PagerDuty publishes the SMS number list so a user can easily validate the sender of the SMS. For more information, see [Notification Phone Numbers](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/notification-phone-numbers){: external}.

Complete the following steps to get an SMS notification when an alert in the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service is triggered:

1. [Create a PagerDuty service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-new-service){: external}.

2. [Configure the support user in PagerDuty who will receive SMS alert messages](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/configuring-a-user-profile){: external}.

   Make sure a valid mobile number is provided for **SMS** in the user's **Contact Information** and that the **Notification Rules** for the user indicates that an SMS is to be sent to the mobile number. If these items are not configured correctly, the user will not receive SMS messages.
