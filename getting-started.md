# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started}

Use {{site.data.keyword.la_full}} to add log management capabilities to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture.
{: shortdesc}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} to manage operating system logs, application logs, and platform logs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers advanced features to filter, search, and tail log data, define alerts, and design custom views to monitor application and system logs.

## Features
{: #getting-started-features}

{{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} provides the following features.

- Troubleshooting logs in real time to diagnose issues and identify problems

    By using the *live streaming tail* feature, developers and DevOps teams can diagnose issues, analyze stack traces and exceptions, identify the source of errors, and monitor different log sources through a single view. 

- Issuing alerts to be notified of important actions
 
    DevOps teams can configure the system so critical or warning alert notifications are sent to email, Slack, webHook, or PagerDuty.  This helps DevOps teams to act promptly on important application and services events.

- Exporting logs to a local file for analysis or to an archive service to meet auditing requirements

    You can export specific log lines to a local copy or archive logs from {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Object Storage.

    Log lines are exported in JSON line format. Logs are archived in JSON format with the metadata that is associated with each line. 

- Controlling logging infrastructure costs by customizing {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} managed logs

    You can control the cost of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} logging infrastructure by configuring the log sources that are collecting and managing logs. 


## Overview
{: #getting-started-ov}

Log data is stored on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

Because {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} is part of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} users must have the following permissions:

* Your users must have platform permissions to create, view, and delete an instance of a service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
* Your users must have platform permissions to create resources within the context of the resource group where the logging instance is provisioned.

To add logging features in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must provision an instance of {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}.

An {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance is provisioned within the context of a resource group. Your services are organized for access control and billing purposes by using resource groups. You can provision the instance in the *default* resource group or in a custom resource group.

After provisioning an instance of {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}, you receive the ingestion key for your account.

After you have your ingestion key, you can configure your log sources:

A log source is a Cloud or on-prem resource that generates logs. For example, a log source can be a Kubernetes cluster.
{: note}

* You can enable a logging instance for a region that hosts logs from enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. For example, to collect logs from an {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_notm}} app, you can enable the *service platform logs* flag. [Learn more](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs). When this feature is enabled, logs are automatically collected.
* You can configure a logging agent for a log source. You use the ingestion key to configure the logging agent that is responsible for collecting and forwarding logs to your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance. After the logging agent is deployed in a log source, logs are collected and forwarded automatically to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance. [Learn more](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-log_analysis_agent).

Once your log sources are configured, you can launch the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} Web UI to view, monitor, and manage your logs from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Menu ![Navigation Menu](images/icon_hamburger.svg) &gt; **Observability** &gt; **Logging** page.

The following figure shows the components comprising the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service that is running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}:

## Step 1. Before you begin
{: #getting-started-prereqs}

1. [Check the regions where the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service is available](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-regions).

2. If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, [register an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}. You need an IBMid to work in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## Step 2. Provision an instance
{: #getting-started-provision}

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

   Click [Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external} to sign in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

   After you log in with your user ID and password, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console opens.

2. Click **Catalog**. The list of the services that are available in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} opens.

3. To filter the list of services that is displayed, click **Services** and select the **Logging and Monitoring** category.

4. Click the **{{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}** tile.

5. Select a region for the service instance.

6. Select the **Lite** service plan.

   By default, the **Lite** plan is set.

   For more information about other service plans, see [Pricing plans](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-service_plans).

7. Specify a **Service name** for your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance.

8. Select the **Default** resource group.

   By default, the **Default** resource group is set.

9. To provision the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} selected resource group, click **Create**.

After you provision an instance, the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} dashboard opens.
