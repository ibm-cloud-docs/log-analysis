# Granting user permissions to a user or service ID
{: #iam_view_events}

{{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Complete the following steps to grant a user or service ID the minimum permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service: 
{: shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #iam_view_events_prereq}

Your user ID needs **administrator platform permissions** to manage the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service. Contact the account administrator. The account owner can grant another user access to the account for the purposes of managing user access, and managing account resources. [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).



## Step 1. Create an access group
{: #iam_view_events_step1}

Complete the following steps to create an access group:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a name and optional description for your group, and click **Create**.

You can delete a group by selecting the **Remove group** option. When you remove a group from the account, you are removing all users and service IDs from the group and all access that is assigned to the group.
{: note}

To create an access group by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_create) command.

```text
ibmcloud iam access-group-create GROUP_NAME [-d, --description DESCRIPTION]
```
{: codeblock}



## Step 2. Add permissions to view events
{: #iam_view_events_step2}

After you set up your group, you can assign a common access policy to the group. 

Any policy that you set for an access group applies to all entities, users and service IDs, within the group. 
{: note}

You can assign the policy by using the UI or through the command line.

To create an access group policy by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command.

```text
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}
```
{: codeblock}

When you define the policy, you need to select a platform role and a service role:
* Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. The platform roles are administrator, editor, operator, viewer. Platform management roles also apply to account management services that enable users to invite users, manage service IDs, access policies, catalog entries, and track billing and usage depending on their assigned role on an account management service.
* Service access roles define a user or serviceâ€™s ability to perform actions on a service instance. The service access roles are manager, writer, and reader.

To manage the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service, a user needs the following roles:
* Platform role: **Viewer**. 
* Service role: **Reader**. 

[Learn more](/docs/services/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam#iam).



Complete the following steps to assign a policy to an access group through the UI:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Select the name of the group that you want to assign access to. 
3. Click **Access policies**.
4. Click **Assign access**.
5. Grant permissions. Choose one of the following options:


### Option 1. Grant permissions on the service
{: #user_opt1}

Complete the following steps: 

1. Select **Assign access to resources**.
2. Select **{{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}**.
3. Select **All current regions**.
4. Select **All current service instances**.
5. Select the platform role **Viewer**.
6. Select the service role **Reader**.
7. Click **Assign**.

### Option 2. Grant permissions within the context of a resource group
{: #user_opt2}

Complete the following steps: 

1. Select **Assign access within a resource group**.
2. Select a resource group.
3. If the user does not have a role that is already granted for the selected resource group, choose a role for the **Assign access to a resource group** field. 

    Depending on the role that you select, the user can view the resource group on their dashboard, edit the resource group name, or manage user access to the group. 
    
    You can select **No access**, if you want the user to have access only to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service in the resource group.

4. Select **{{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}**.
5. Select the platform role **Viewer**.
6. Select the service role **Reader**.
7. Click **Assign**.

### Option 3. Grant permissions in a location
{: #user_opt3}

You can only provision 1 instance per location. Therefore, to grant permissions to view events in a region, complete the following steps: 

1. Select **Assign access to resources**.
2. Select **{{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}**.
3. Select the instance in the region that the user must have permission to see events.
4. Select the platform role **Viewer**.
5. Select the service role **Reader**.
6. Click **Assign**.


## Step 3. Add a user to the access group
{: #iam_view_events_step3}

Continue to set up your group by adding users or service IDs.

### Add a user to the access group
{: #iam_manage_events_step3_user}

Complete the following steps to add a user:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Select the name of the group that you want to assign access to. 
3. Click **Add users** on the **Users** tab.
4. Select the users that you want to add from the list, and click **Add to group**.


### Add a service ID to the access group
{: #iam_manage_events_step3_svcid}

Complete the following steps to add a service ID:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Select the name of the group that you want to assign access to. 
3. Click the **Service IDs** tab, and click **Add service ID**.
4. Select the IDs that you want to add from the list, and click **Add to group**.
