# Logging with Cloud Foundry
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs}

In {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} public, you can monitor logs from Cloud Foundry resources that run in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or outside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service. You can view, filter, search, and analyze these logs through the web UI for a number of days that is determined by the plan of your logging instance. You can also configure archiving, and have access to those logs through the archived files.
{: shortdesc}

If your Cloud Foundry resources run on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public, you can choose to automatically collect these logs and monitor them through the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance that is provisioned in the same region, and that is enabled to host service platform logs. Alternatively, you can choose to configure a custom user provided (CUPS) service for your app, so system and application logs are collected and streamed to a custom logging instance.

If your Cloud Foundry resources run on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dedicated or outside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can configure a custom user provided (CUPS) service for your app, so system and application logs are collected and streamed to a custom logging instance.

## Choosing a method to monitor Cloud Foundry resource logs
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_public_options}

You have different options to collect and forward logs to an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service:
* You can configure 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service per region with the flag **service platform logs**. This instance collects infrastructure and application logs for any Cloud Foundry apps that run on that same region.
* You can configure a custom user provided service (CUPS) for each Cloud Foundry app that you want to monitor through a custom {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance. The CUPS service sends logs via a syslog link to a logging syslog endpoint and port. This option is only available if the Cloud Foundry app send logs to STDOUT and STDERR. If the Cloud Foundry app is configured to send logs via syslog and not to STDOUT and STDERR, this option is not supported.

If you choose to send your Cloud Foundry logs by configuring a custom user provided (CUPS) service for your app, you must enable a port to send logs via syslog to your logging instance. If you are using (a) the classic syslog protocol, (b) a custom port in `syslog-ng`, or (c) a custom port in `rsyslog`, there is no authentication available and anyone with knowledge of the endpoint can submit logs to your instance.  Depending on your environment, this may present a significant security risk. Use these configurations at your organizationâ€™s own risk.  Validate with your compliance and security teams whether this security risk is acceptable to your organization.

Another consideration is the restriction that you can apply to users to control access to view logs in a logging instance. You can use [IAM to manage users and their access to view logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-work_iam)
.
* When you use the method of a single logging instance to host platform logs, all logs from Cloud Foundry resources that run on that region are available for view through the instance. Any user with a service role `viewer` can see any log entries.

* When you use the method of sending Cloud Foundry app logs to a custom logging instance, users with a service role `viewer` can only see logs from Cloud Foundry app logs that are configured to stream logs to this logging instance.

In both cases, users can also view logs from other sources that you might have configured to forward logs to the instance.

## Monitor Cloud Foundry resources that are hosted in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_public}

CF resources are location bound resources in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For example, you can have a Cloud Foundry app running in the Dallas (us-south) region.

In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can configure 1 logging instance to collect and host platform services logs in a region. After the instance is provisioned and configured in a region, logs that are generated from enabled services in that region such as Cloud Foundry apps or Cloud Foundry infrastructure are automatically collected and forwarded through the ELK-Adatper. You can monitor logs through this logging instance.

To configure an instance from the Observability dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs).



## Configuring a Cloud Foundry app to forward logs to a custom logging instance by using Syslog drains
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains}

You can configure a Cloud Foundry (CF) application, running in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or outside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, to stream application logs to an instance of the the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service. You can configure a secure connection or a TLS connection between the Cloud Foundry app and the logging instance.

If you choose to send your Cloud Foundry logs by configuring a custom user provided (CUPS) service for your app, you must enable a port to send logs via syslog to your logging instance. If you are using (a) the classic syslog protocol, (b) a custom port in `syslog-ng`, or (c) a custom port in `rsyslog`, there is no authentication available and anyone with knowledge of the endpoint can submit logs to your instance. As a result, depending on your environment, your use of the classic syslog protocol or custom port configurations with `syslog-ng` or `rsyslog` may present a significant security risk.  Use these configurations at your organization's own risk.  Validate with your compliance and security teams whether this security risk is acceptable to your organization.
{: important}

To send Cloud Foundry logs to a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance, consider the following information:
* In the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance, you must provision a syslog port in the logging instance where you want to forward logs.
* In CF, you must define a custom user-provided service (CUPS) instance to deliver the logging instance credentials to the Cloud Foundry app, and to trigger streaming of application logs to the syslog port that you enabled in your {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance.
* In the *Platform Logs* {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance, you must configure an exclusion rule.


### Before you begin
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains_prereqs}

Use a user ID that is a member or an owner of an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. To get an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} user ID, go to: [Registration](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.

[Your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}ID must have assigned IAM policies for each of the following resources](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-work_iam). For example, to work in the US-south region and in the default resource group, you need the following permissions:

| Resource                             | Scope of the access policy | Role    | Region    | Information                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Resource group **Default**           |  Resource group            | Viewer  | us-south  | This policy is required to allow the user to see service instances in the Default resource group.    |
| {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service |  Resource group      | Editor  | us-south  | This policy is required to allow the user to provision and administer the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service in the Default resource group.   |
{: caption="Table 1. List of IAM policies" caption-side="top"}

In {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}ID must have the **developer** role assigned for the Cloud Foundry space where the Cloud Foundry application is running. Outside the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, you must have permissions to configure a CUPS service for the Cloud Foundry app that you want to collect and monitor logs.

You must install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. For more information, see [Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started). This CLI includes the Cloud Foundry CLI.

You must have a Cloud Foundry app deployed and running.


### Step1: Provision an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains_step1}

To provision a service instance of {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, see [Provisioning an instance](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-provision).

### Step 2: Provision a syslog port in the logging instance
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains_step2}

1. [Launch the logging web UI.](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-launch)

    You launch the web UI within the context of an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI.

2. Provision a port. From the logging web UI, complete the following steps:

    1. Open the log sources panel on the logging web UI. Select the *Install instructions icon*: ![Install instructions icon](../images/logdna_install.png "Install instructions icon")

    2. Select **View Syslog** &gt; **Syslog**.

    3. Click **Provision a Syslog port**.

    A port is displayed. Copy the port.


### Step 3: Configure a user-provided service instance for your Cloud Foundry app
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains_step3}

Complete the following steps:

1. Create a custom user-provided service instance (CUPS). Specify the URL of the logging service with the option `-l`.

    To create a CUPS instance without security enabled, run the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf cups SVC_INSTANCE_NAME -l syslog://SYSLOG_ENDPOINT_URL:PORT_NUMBER
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    To create a CUPS instance with TLS enabled, run the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf cups SVC_INSTANCE_NAME -l syslog-tls://SYSLOG_ENDPOINT_URL:PORT_NUMBER
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where

    *SVC_INSTANCE_NAME* is the name of the Cloud Foundry service instance.

    *SYSLOG_ENDPOINT_URL* is the endpoint URL in the region where the instance is running. [List of syslog endpoints](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-endpoints#endpoints_syslog). For example, for us-south, the URL is: `syslog-a.us-south.logging.cloud.ibm.com`

    *PORT_NUMBER* is the port number that you provisioned in your logging instance.

    A sample command looks as follows:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf CUPS MyCFsvcInstance -l syslog://syslog-a.us-south.logging.cloud.ibm.com:49235
    ```
    {: screen}

    Notice that if you do not include `syslog://` or `syslog-tls://` in the URL, you get the following error:  *ERR Invalid syslog drain URL: parse failure*.
    {: important}

2. Bind the service. Run the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf bind-service CF_APP_NAME SVC_INSTANCE_NAME
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where

    * *CF_APP_NAME* is the name of the Cloud Foundry application.

    * *SVC_INSTANCE_NAME* is the name of the Cloud Foundry service instance.

    A sample command looks as follows:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf bind-service MyCFapp MyCFsvcInstance
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Restage the Cloud Foundry application. Run the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf restage CF_APP_NAME
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where *CF_APP_NAME* is the name of the Cloud Foundry application.

     A sample command looks as follows:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf restage MyCFapp
    ```
    {: screen}


### Step 4: Verify that Cloud Foundry app logs are displayed through the logging web UI
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_drains_step4}

Launch the logging web UI. Then, search for your Cloud Foundry application logs. For more information, see [Filtering logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-view_logs#view_logs_step5).

Try also some of these tasks:
- [Search logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-view_logs#view_logs_step6)
- [Define views](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-view_logs#view_logs_step7)
- [Configure alerts](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-alerts)

**Note:** Some of these features require a plan upgrade.


## Stop viewing Cloud Foundry logs through the logging instance that is configured to collect service platform logs
{: #monitor_cfapp_logs_exclude}

When you configure a logging instance in a region to collect the service platform logs, Cloud Foundry logs are collected automatically and available through that instance.

For example, you might have configured your Cloud Foundry apps to forward logs to custom logging instances by using Syslog drains because you have a requirement to isolate logs by environment or by line of business. In this use case, you must configure a logging exclusion rule on the *Platform Logs* logging instance.

To hide Cloud Foundry logs in the *Platform Logs* logging instance, you must configure a logging exclusion rule on this instance.
{: important}

Complete the following steps to configure an exclusion rule on the *Platform Logs* logging instance for each region:

You must repeat these steps in any region where you want to stop viewing Cloud Foundry logs through the *Platform Logs* logging instance.
{: note}

You must have **manager** role on that instance to configure exclusion rules.
{: note}

1. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.

2. Click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) &gt; **Observability**.

3. Click **Logging**.

    The list of instances that are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is displayed.

4. Select the instance that has the *Platform Logs* flag set in the region. Then, click **Open dashboard**.

    The Web UI opens.

5. Click the **Settings** icon ![Configuration icon](../images/admin.png "Admin icon").

6. Select **Usage** &gt; **Exclusion rules**.

7. Click **Add a rule**.

8. Enter a description of the rule. For example, you can enter `Remove all Cloud Foundry logs from Service Platform logs`.

9. In the *Sources* section, select **cloudfoundry**.

10. Ensure that the following option is not selected: `Preserve these lines for live-tail and alerting`

    This action ensures that Cloud Foundry logs are not visible to users.
    {: important}

11. Click **Save**.
