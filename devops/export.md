# Exporting logs through the logging UI

You can export log data in JSONL format from an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance graphically through the web UI.
{: shortdesc}

<!-- common deprecation notice -->
{{../_include-segments/deprecation_notice.md}}

Consider the following information when you export log data:
* You can export a set of log entries. To define the set of data that you want to export, you can apply filter and searches. You can also specify the time range.
* From the Web UI, when you export logs, you get an email that is sent to your email address, with a link to a compressed file that includes the data. To get the data, you must click the link and download the compressed file.
* The compressed log file that contains the data that you want to export is available for a maximum of 12 hours.
* When you export logs, you have a limit of lines that you can export in a request. You can specify to export older lines or newer lines in case you reach the limit in the time range that you specify for the export.
